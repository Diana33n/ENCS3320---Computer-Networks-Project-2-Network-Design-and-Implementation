# ENCS3320 - Computer Networks Project #2: Network Design and Implementation

This repository contains the design, configuration, and implementation files for a network topology created in **ENCS3320 – Computer Networks**. The project demonstrates subnetting, routing, server setup, and end-to-end testing using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to design a scalable and efficient network for a medium-sized organization. The topology integrates multiple subnets, routers, end devices, and servers. Routing is implemented using **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** protocol. Additional configurations include DNS and HTTP servers.

## Key Features

* **IP Subnetting**: Designed an IPv4 addressing scheme using `112.3.8.0/22` with efficient subnetting for different network areas.
* **Topology**: Four routers interconnected with serial links, supporting four LAN areas (NET1–NET4).
* **Routing Protocol**: OSPF configured with multiple areas for scalability and efficiency.
* **Servers**: HTTP/Web server and DNS server configured in NET2.
* **End Device Configuration**: PCs and laptops with static IP, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS settings.
* **Testing**: Verified connectivity using `ping`, `tracert`, and HTTP access from all devices.

## How to Open and Run

### Requirements

* Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.1 or later)



## Report Highlights (G10.pdf)

* **Task 0**: IP subnetting and assignment
* **Task 1**: Building the topology and configuring routers
* **Task 2**: Setting up DNS and HTTP servers
* **Task 3**: OSPF routing setup with verification commands
* **Task 4**: Testing with `ping`, `tracert`, and browser access
* **Appendix**: Custom HTML code for HTTP server
